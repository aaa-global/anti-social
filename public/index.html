									<p>Please tell me what we are competing for again? I have forgotten while floating on clouds of Western arrogance that smell of Chanel and fresh retro Air Maxes you can no longer buy in-store.</p>
									<p>Wait, let me turn down the misogyny, I mean radio. I can no longer hear when police take shots at Black dignity. #blackmusicmatters</p>
									<p>Will you please ask the Auctioneer who has the highest bid on Black pride and whatever remains of our African antiquity. I can’t tell anymore and Christmas is coming fast so we really need to budget our politics because heritage and misappropriation acknowledgements are expensive gifts they don’t sell on Amazon.</p>
									<p>I guess Black Love got a little different after we left those slave ships. Please tell Mary I don’t want, “No More Karma.”</p>
									<p>Three generations of Chinese wealth said it’s important we get our money right cause that sh*t ruins relationships and right now American politicians are inexpensive but bangin’ hair weaves are still hittin’ for at least a couple hundred every 6–8 weeks so black women please prioritize carefully.</p>
									<p>Must we choose between social consciousness or ‘Slaying the Gram’? Is it tough to preach self-worth to the kids when you ain’t living right? Somebody call Sway, we need answers and Kanye needs rest.</p>
									<p>Please tell the brothers and sisters where to find the 36th Chamber that arms us with love and positivity. J. Cole I’m happy you’re feeling liberated bro, I see you trying to bring the Wu Back. </p?>
									<p>Tell the jaded ones Johannesburg may be their New Jerusalem. I’m returning from the temples of Maboneng, and Stella got her Truth back. </p>
									<p>It’s hard to trace your history when your being is dotted with I’s so attached to an individual identity that you forget you are the Universe.</p>



									<p>All the statistics I read are f*cked, can we find some new math? This broken record sounds like bad rap lyrics and trap beats, I need a breather from your opinion on why I’m not gonna get married. </p>
									<p>I grew up with T-boz and Janet, how we let one fake ass pollute the culture? Brandy killed it in overalls and I’m praying daily for the overhaul of what the black female body is supposed to look like.</p>
									<p>I guess cause you wifed her you forgot we was family? Those pretty kids got you talkin to yo momma crazy and blamin your sister for having babies with the homie who used to be your friend. It’s not about Becky, it’s about when he said black women ain’t sh*t. That was a little heavy, let’s take five.</p>
									<p>What time is the funeral for the dreams of single-black mothers who never received any child support from irresponsible lovers we call, “men that were not ready.” Please don’t wait for the punchline. There are nothing but dial tones at the end of our calls to be heard and deeply cared for. <click>.</p>

									<p>The Brother said he is in pursuit of consciousness and financial freedom. That resonates. 
									<p>I typically just scroll past the inexplicably racist comments on every YouTube page. It’s hard to be fazed by hatred you’ve never understood and racists you’ve never had coffee with.</p>
									<p>God told me when things get too human, return to Spirt. Please pardon the abrupt disconnection and lack of empathy, I have not been ‘in my feelings’ lately, and it feels amazing to not feel shame on me. </p>
									<p>I’ll let you know when I’m back from this guilt trip called being a Black woman. Hit me on What’s App if you want to act out some of those misogynistic lyrics. #ornah.</p>
									<p>I asked White Jesus if I could take this black skin off for just one day. Trump said, “only if you let me watch.” My Skagen says it is 1:45pm. What is Time when you and your late grandmother watched the same Sun set on the unfathomable exploits of wealthy white men? </p>
									<p>You figure the Cavs rigged Game 7 but Trump didn’t purchase the 2016 presidential election? Leave it to the Democrats to take the blue pill, so ready to be ‘woke’. I thought you were joking when you said, “It was hard to pick.” </p>
									<p>I’m gazing into Moonlight with dreams of burning white picket Fences. Denzel, Viola and Mr. Jenkins, I am counting on you to get us talking about some real sh*t.</p>


									<p>Even guided meditations can be hard to follow. They say the shift is coming and I believe it. My ego is thinking to my Self, “what will I be wearing when self-realization shows up at my doorstep”?</p>
									<p>Me, myself, and I, we realize suffering is born in attachment, so hold your words when I tell you that I care deeply but also give no fucks about [**shit**].</p>
									<p>They should have called it, The Unworthy Black Queen. </p>
									<p>I guess it does get Awkward when they praise you while they rape you and change the channel when you come talking about how, “black men don’t appreciate you”. It’s ain’t Disney when Nala gets curved by her Lion Dream. </p>
									<p>I don’t know any black women who haven’t beats their odds, do you?</p>
									<p>My homegirl, sister, auntie and momma have more stories to tell than failed love. No matter our partner, we still gon play our hand and get our books. Let’s trade romantic tragedies that highlight black love disparities for spades of joy and stories of substance.</p>
									<p>I feel like I can only truly appreciate trending topics when they are no longer going Mary Poppins. Tell the social trolls and Trump Van Dykes who never comment but read your comments to pardon my Blackness.</p>

									<p>You know you getting back in your soul when the slang doesn’t resonate. This may be difficult to swallow so open your mouth slowly: you are asleep and this is not reality. </p>
									<p>I’m sharing guided mediations to contribute to the shift. You busy cropping selfies and trying to choose a filter. We will never be whole if you keep socially assassinating all the natural-born healers.</p>
									<p>Girl, this is Africa, the gratuity is already included.</p>

<p>My Science teacher sa My Science teacher sa</p>

											My Science teacher said that people of color have an M-chromosome called
											Melanin that endows them with faster metabolisms and more fast-twitch muscle
											 fibers than other humans so they barely feel the psychological weight of
											 human disenfranchisement, especially during athletic training and competition.

                    <p><span class="text yellow">I was like, ni**a you lyin.</span></p>
                    <p> He was like, "Do you feel better when you compete
										as an athlete?". </p>
                    <p>I was like, "Yeah, duh...everyone do".</p>
                    <p> He was like,
										"Do you also feel more proud about being Black and your 'genetic endowment'".
										</p>
                    <p>I was like, "Daaaaammmnn, I kinda do though."</p>
                    <p> That sh*t cray, right?</p>
                    <p> I never really thought about it like that but he was makin sense tho'.</p>
										<p>He was like,"What if slavery happened but black people were somehow below average at s
									ports?".</p>
									<p>I was like, "OMG. Stop! My brain is about to explode from the pain
									of thinking about that sh*t".</p>
									<p>Then he was like, "What if black people were intellectual slaves and endowed instead with 400-years of mental prowess and
									cognitive dominance?"</p>
									<p>I was like, "I can't. Too much. Process overload. I
								 know this is somehow like a good thing but let's just chill because I just
								 got hella excited and then wanted to die." </p>
								 <p>Then, he took it there with, "Now, let's unwind all of that. Let's say Black American slavery never
									happened. Black America as we know it, never happened. The Caribbean, South
									America, all major black slave trades, erased from history. Let's even remove
									the colonization of African countries and all foreign rule over majority black
									 populations. How do you feel about that?". </p>
									 <p>It was at this point that I was
									 completely f*cked up in thought and unable to escape the mind-bending
									 exploration of what he was saying."  </p>
