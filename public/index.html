									<p>Please tell me what we are competing for again? I have forgotten while floating on clouds of Western arrogance that smell of Chanel and fresh retro Air Maxes you can no longer buy in-store.</p>
									<p>Wait, let me turn down the misogyny, I mean radio. I can no longer hear when police take shots at Black dignity. #blackmusicmatters</p>
									<p>Will you please ask the Auctioneer who has the highest bid on Black pride and whatever remains of our African antiquity. I can’t tell anymore and Christmas is coming fast so we really need to budget our politics because heritage and misappropriation acknowledgements are expensive gifts they don’t sell on Amazon.</p>
									<p>I guess Black Love got a little different after we left those slave ships. Please tell Mary I don’t want, “No More Karma.”</p>
									<p>Three generations of Chinese wealth said it’s important we get our money right cause that sh*t ruins relationships and right now American politicians are inexpensive but bangin’ hair weaves are still hittin’ for at least a couple hundred every 6–8 weeks so black women please prioritize carefully.</p>
									<p>Must we choose between social consciousness or ‘Slaying the Gram’? Is it tough to preach self-worth to the kids when you ain’t living right? Somebody call Sway, we need answers and Kanye needs rest.</p>
									<p>Please tell the brothers and sisters where to find the 36th Chamber that arms us with love and positivity. J. Cole I’m happy you’re feeling liberated bro, I see you trying to bring the Wu Back. </p?>
									<p>Tell the jaded ones Johannesburg may be their New Jerusalem. I’m returning from the temples of Maboneng, and Stella got her Truth back. </p>
									<p>It’s hard to trace your history when your being is dotted with I’s so attached to an individual identity that you forget you are the Universe.</p>





<p>My Science teacher sa My Science teacher sa</p>
										<p>

											My Science teacher said that people of color have an M-chromosome called
											Melanin that endows them with faster metabolisms and more fast-twitch muscle
											 fibers than other humans so they barely feel the psychological weight of
											 human disenfranchisement, especially during athletic training and competition.
										</p>
                    <p><span class="text yellow">I was like, ni**a you lyin.</span></p>
                    <p> He was like, "Do you feel better when you compete
										as an athlete?". </p>
                    <p>I was like, "Yeah, duh...everyone do".</p>
                    <p> He was like,
										"Do you also feel more proud about being Black and your 'genetic endowment'".
										</p>
                    <p>I was like, "Daaaaammmnn, I kinda do though."</p>
                    <p> That sh*t cray, right?</p>
                    <p> I never really thought about it like that but he was makin sense tho'.</p>
										<p>He was like,"What if slavery happened but black people were somehow below average at s
									ports?".</p>
									<p>I was like, "OMG. Stop! My brain is about to explode from the pain
									of thinking about that sh*t".</p>
									<p>Then he was like, "What if black people were intellectual slaves and endowed instead with 400-years of mental prowess and
									cognitive dominance?"</p>
									<p>I was like, "I can't. Too much. Process overload. I
								 know this is somehow like a good thing but let's just chill because I just
								 got hella excited and then wanted to die." </p>
								 <p>Then, he took it there with, "Now, let's unwind all of that. Let's say Black American slavery never
									happened. Black America as we know it, never happened. The Caribbean, South
									America, all major black slave trades, erased from history. Let's even remove
									the colonization of African countries and all foreign rule over majority black
									 populations. How do you feel about that?". </p>
									 <p>It was at this point that I was
									 completely f*cked up in thought and unable to escape the mind-bending
									 exploration of what he was saying."  </p>
